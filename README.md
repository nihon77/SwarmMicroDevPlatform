# Development Environment Setup on Oracle Cloud Free Tier (ARM)

This guide walks you through creating a lightweight, fully open-source development environment on **two ARM Oracle Cloud Free Tier instances**.  
Oracle's Free Tier provides always-free ARM-based instances, ideal for running modern containerized development environments free of charge.

Using **Docker Swarm** on these instances gives you a simple yet powerful container orchestration experience‚Äîoften described as _"Kubernetes for the budget-conscious"_ or a _"lighter Coolify"_.  
Unlike full Kubernetes, Docker Swarm is easy to set up and maintain for small teams or solo developers.

Our stack uses:

- **Docker Swarm** for orchestration
- **Traefik** as a reverse proxy/load balancer with automatic SSL
- **Portainer** for visual management of the stack
- **Woodpecker CI** for continuous integration and deployment ([Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org/))

---

## ‚ú® Advantages of This Solution

- **Lightweight:** All components are optimized to run efficiently on ARM instances with limited resources.
- **Free:** Based on Oracle Cloud Free Tier and free services like DuckDNS.
- **Scalable:** Easily add more nodes to the Docker Swarm cluster as needed.
- **Simple to Configure:** Single `docker-compose.yml` for the stack, Traefik with automatic certificates.
- **Vendor Independent:** No vendor lock-in with expensive proprietary tools.
- **Remote Management:** Portainer provides an intuitive web UI for managing the entire stack.

---

## ‚ö° Requirements

- Oracle Cloud account with Free Tier enabled
- **2 ARM instances (Ampere A1):**
  - Ubuntu Server 22.04
  - 2 vCPUs, 12 GB RAM
  - Static public IP addresses
- Registered wildcard DNS under DuckDNS, e.g. `*.oci-w3style.duckdns.org`
- DuckDNS token
- SSH keypair for instance access
- GitHub account for Woodpecker CI integration

## üñ•Ô∏è Creating the ARM Instances on Oracle Cloud Platform

1. **Log in to [Oracle Cloud Platform](https://cloud.oracle.com/) and navigate to Compute > Instances.**
2. **Create two new instances** (e.g., `manager` and `node1`):
    - **Shape:** Select *Ampere A1 Compute* (ARM).
    - **Image:** Choose **Ubuntu Server 22.04** (recommended for compatibility).
    - **CPU/RAM:** 2 OCPUs, 12 GB RAM.
    - **Boot Volume:** 100 GB.
    - **SSH Access:** Upload your SSH public key or paste it into the SSH key field for secure access.

3. **Assign a Static Public IP to the Manager Instance (after instance creation):**
    - After creating your instances, in the Oracle Cloud dashboard, go to **Networking > Virtual Cloud Networks** and select your VCN.
    - Under **Resources**, click **Public IPs** and allocate a new static public IP address.
    - Attach this static IP to the network interface of your `manager` instance by editing its settings.
    - The `node1` instance does not require a public IP; it will communicate internally within the VCN.

4. **Access your instances via SSH:**
    ```sh
    ssh ubuntu@<INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>
    ```
    Replace `<INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>` with the actual public IP address of your instance.

5. **Update the system for latest security patches and features:**
    ```sh
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

6. **Configure Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) using systemd-resolved:**
    - Edit the resolved configuration:
      ```sh
      sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
      ```
    - Find or add the `DNS=` line and set it to Cloudflare's DNS servers:
      ```
      DNS=1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
      ```
    - (Optional) To ensure only these DNS servers are used, add or uncomment:
      ```
      DNSStubListener=yes
      ```
    - Save and exit the editor.
    - Restart systemd-resolved to apply changes:
      ```sh
      sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
      ```
    - Verify DNS is set correctly:
      ```sh
      systemd-resolve --status | grep 'DNS Servers'
      ```

## üåê Configuring DuckDNS Dynamic DNS

> üí° **Tip:**  
> You can use your own DNS provider instead of DuckDNS, as long as it supports **wildcard DNS records** and **DNS-01 challenge** for Let's Encrypt certificate issuance and renewal.  
> Wildcard DNS records are also essential for enabling dynamic app creation: you can deploy new apps or services on any subdomain without manually adding DNS records each time.  
> This allows Traefik (or other reverse proxies) to automatically generate and renew SSL certificates for all your subdomains, and route traffic to new apps as soon as they're deployed.  
> Check your DNS provider's documentation to ensure compatibility with Let's Encrypt DNS challenge and wildcard records.


1. Go to [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/), log in, and create a new subdomain.
2. Assign the IP of the static IP created for the `arm1` instance.
3. DuckDNS automatically manages 4th-level subdomains for your chosen 3rd-level subdomain.
4. With DuckDNS, you can use the DNS API for Let's Encrypt certificate management.

---

## üë∑ Installing Docker on Both Instances

```sh
# 1. Remove any old versions of Docker and related components if present.
sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

# 2. Update the package index.
sudo apt update

# 3. Install dependencies required to add Docker's official GPG key and repository.
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

# 4. Create the directory for Docker's GPG key.
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings

# 5. Download Docker's official GPG key and save it in the directory.
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$ID")/gpg \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# 6. Add Docker's official repository to your system's sources list.
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$ID") \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# 7. Update the package index again to include Docker packages from the new repository.
sudo apt update

# 8. Install Docker Engine, CLI, Containerd, Buildx, and the Compose plugin.
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# 9. Add your user to the 'docker' group to run Docker commands without sudo.
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# 10. Apply the group membership change to your current session (or simply log out and log back in).
newgrp docker # or log out and log back in

# 11. Run a test container to verify that Docker is installed correctly.
docker run hello-world
```

## üåü Initializing Docker Swarm Cluster

Docker Swarm lets you manage a cluster (group) of Docker hosts as a single, highly available system.  
A Swarm consists of two roles:
- **Manager node:** Handles cluster management and orchestration.
- **Worker node:** Runs containers as instructed by the manager.

### Step 1: Initialize the Manager Node

On your main (manager) server, run:

```sh
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER_IP>
```

Replace <MANAGER_IP> with the public static IP address of your manager node (the main server).
This command initializes Docker Swarm on your manager and prints a docker swarm join command containing a unique token.
Copy the entire output, especially the docker swarm join command, as you will use it on your worker nodes.

Example output:

```sh
Swarm initialized: current node (abcd1234...) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-xxxx <MANAGER_IP>:2377
```

### Step 2: Join Worker Nodes

On every worker node you want to add, use the join command you copied earlier from the manager node:

```sh
docker swarm join --token <WORKER_TOKEN> <MANAGER_IP>:2377
```

- **<WORKER_TOKEN>** is the token portion from your manager's output.
- **<MANAGER_IP>** is the same public IP of your manager node.
- **Port 2377** is the default port for Docker Swarm management.

>Tip:
>If you lose the join command or want to add more nodes later, just run this on the manager to get the current worker token:
>```sh
>docker swarm join-token worker
>```

### Step 3: Verify Your Swarm Cluster

Back on your manager node, list all Swarm nodes:

```sh
docker node ls
```
You should see your manager and all joined workers listed, including their status and roles.
If you see Ready under "STATUS", your nodes are successfully connected.

## üìÅ Prepare Directory Structure for the Main Stack

Before launching the stack, set up the necessary directories and files for Traefik and the Docker registry.  
Run the following commands on your manager node:

```sh
# 1. Create a working directory for your stack and move into it.
mkdir ~/swarm-oci && cd ~/swarm-oci

# 2. Clone this repository into your working directory.
git clone https://github.com/nihon77/SwarmMicroDevPlatform.git .

# 3. Create a directory for Let's Encrypt certificates and a secure file for Traefik's ACME data.
mkdir letsencrypt && touch letsencrypt/acme.json && chmod 600 letsencrypt/acme.json

# 4. Create directories for the Docker registry's authentication and data storage.
mkdir -p registry/auth registry/data
```

These directories and files are required for Traefik and the registry to function correctly when you deploy the stack.

## üîë Set Up Registry Authentication and Overlay Network
> üí° **Tip:**
> You can also use public container registries like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [Quay.io](https://quay.io/), or [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/features/packages) to store and distribute your images.  
>  
> Use your private registry only if you want to keep your images confidential or avoid publishing them to public registries.
Before deploying the stack, complete these two steps on your manager node:

1. **Create a password file for the private Docker registry:**

    ```sh
    docker run --entrypoint htpasswd httpd:2 -Bbn admin Pa55Word > registry/auth/htpasswd
    ```

    This command generates a bcrypt-encrypted password file with username `admin` and password `Pa55Word` for registry authentication.

2. **Create the Traefik overlay network for inter-service communication:**

    ```sh
    docker network create --driver=overlay traefik-net
    ```

    This network allows Traefik, Portainer, and other services to communicate securely across the Swarm cluster.
## üìù Configure the `.env` File for Your Installation

Before launching the stack, you must set up the environment variables used by `main-stack.yml` and other configuration files.

1. **Rename the `.env_example` file to `.env`:**

    ```sh
    mv .env_example .env
    ```

2. **Open the `.env` file with your preferred editor:**

    ```sh
    nano .env
    ```

3. **Fill in all required variables** as indicated by the comments in the file.  
   Here‚Äôs an overview of the most important variables and how to obtain their values:

    - `DOMAIN_BASE`:  
      The full base domain for your deployment, in the format `<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org` (e.g., `oci-w3style.duckdns.org`).  
      You can find your subdomain in your [DuckDNS account](https://www.duckdns.org/).

    - `DUCKDNS_TOKEN`:  
      Your personal DuckDNS token, required for dynamic IP updates and SSL certificate generation.  
      Available in your DuckDNS dashboard after logging in.

    - `CERT_EMAIL`:  
      A valid email address, used by Let's Encrypt for SSL certificate management.

    - `CERT_RESOLVER`:  
      The DNS provider used for certificate resolution (e.g., `duckdns`, `ovh`, `cloudflare`).  
      Set this to match your DNS provider. This value tells Traefik which DNS challenge provider to use for SSL certificates.

    - **Other provider-specific variables:**  
      The `.env` file also includes variables for alternative DNS providers such as OVH and Cloudflare (e.g., `OVH_ENDPOINT`, `OVH_APPLICATION_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`).  
      Fill these in only if you are using one of these providers instead of DuckDNS. Refer to your provider's documentation to obtain the required values.

4. **Save and close the file** once you have finished editing.


## üß∞ Deploy the Main Stack with Docker Compose (`main-stack.yml`)

This step will launch the core services: **Traefik**, **Portainer**, and the **private Docker registry**.

### 1. Deploy the Stack

On your **manager node**, run:

```sh
docker stack deploy -c main-stack.yml main-stack
```

This command deploys the stack defined in `main-stack.yml` under the name `main-stack`.

- **Traefik** will handle reverse proxying and SSL.
- **Portainer** provides a web UI for managing your Docker Swarm.
- **Docker Registry** is your private image repository.

### 2. Accessing Services

- **Registry:** `https://registry.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org`
- **Portainer:** `https://portainer.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org`

Replace `<your-subdomain>` with your actual DuckDNS subdomain.


### 3. Authenticate the Docker Registry on All Nodes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention:**  
> The following step must be performed **on all nodes** in the cluster (both manager and worker).

To push and pull images from your private registry, log in from **every node** (manager and worker):

```sh
docker login registry.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org
```

Enter the username and password you configured earlier (for example, `admin` / `Pa55Word`).  
This creates a `~/.docker/config.json` file containing your registry credentials.

Next, copy this file to the system-wide Docker config location so that all services (including those running as root) can access the credentials:

```sh
sudo cp ~/.docker/config.json /etc/docker/config.json
```

Repeat these commands on **every node** in the Swarm cluster.

---

Your base stack is now deployed and ready for use.  
You can manage your cluster via Portainer and push/pull images to your private registry securely.

## üöÄ Example: Deploying a Test Service (`whoami-stack.yaml`)

A

To verify your Swarm and Traefik setup, deploy a simple test service using the [containous/whoami](https://hub.docker.com/r/containous/whoami) image. This service echoes HTTP request information and is useful for testing routing and SSL.

### 1. Create `whoami-stack.yaml`

Create a file named `whoami-stack.yaml` with the following content.  
**Replace** `your-subdomain` with your actual DuckDNS subdomain:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  whoami:
    image: traefik/whoami
    networks:
      - traefik-net
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      labels:
        - "traefik.enable=true"
        - "traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule=Host(`whoami.${DOMAIN_BASE}`)"
        - "traefik.http.routers.whoami.entrypoints=websecure"
        - "traefik.http.routers.whoami.tls.certresolver=${CERT_RESOLVER}"
        - "traefik.http.services.whoami.loadbalancer.server.port=80"

networks:
  traefik-net:
    external: true
```

### 2. Deploy the Stack

On your manager node, run:

```sh
docker stack deploy -c whoami-stack.yaml whoami
```

### 3. Test Access

Visit `https://whoami.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org` in your browser.  
You should see a page displaying request and container info, confirming Traefik routing and SSL are working.

>After deploying the `whoami` stack, you can use the following Docker commands to verify its status, inspect logs, and manage the stack:
>
>### üîç Check Service Status
>
>List all running services in the stack:
>```sh
>docker stack services whoami
>```
>
>List all containers (tasks) for the stack:
>```sh
>docker stack ps whoami --no-trunk
>```
>
>### üìÑ View Logs
>
>Show logs for the `whoami` service:
>```sh
>docker service logs whoami_whoami
>```
>Or, to follow logs in real time:
>```sh
>docker service logs -f whoami_whoami
>```
>
>### üõë Stop and Remove the Stack
>
>To remove (stop and delete) the `whoami` stack and all its services:
>```sh
>docker stack rm whoami
>```
>
>### üîÑ Restart the Stack
>
>To redeploy the stack (useful after changes to the YAML file):
>```sh
>docker stack deploy -c whoami-stack.yaml whoami
>```
>
>#### Forcing Image Re-download
>
>To force Docker to pull the latest image and redeploy:
>```sh
>docker service update --force --with-registry-auth whoami_whoami
>```
>Or, redeploy the stack after removing the service:
>```sh
>docker service rm whoami_whoami
>docker stack deploy -c whoami-stack.yaml whoami
>```


---

## üõ†Ô∏è Example: Deploying a Stack via Portainer

### 1. First Login and Password Change

When you access Portainer for the first time at `https://portainer.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org`, you will be prompted to set an admin password.  
**Choose a strong password and save it securely.**

> **Note:**  
> After changing the password, Portainer may ask you to restart its container for the changes to take effect.

To restart the Portainer service from your manager node, run:

```sh
docker service update --force main-stack_portainer
```

This command forces a restart of the Portainer service within your Swarm stack.

---

### 2. Deploy via Portainer

1. Log in to Portainer at `https://portainer.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org`.
2. Go to **Stacks** > **Add stack**.
3. Name your stack (e.g., `whoami`).
4. Paste the contents of your `whoami-stack.yaml` into the **Web editor**.
5. Click **Deploy the stack**.

Portainer will deploy the stack to your Swarm cluster.  
You can now manage, update, or remove the stack from the Portainer UI.


Portainer allows you to deploy stacks directly from its web UI.


### 2. Deploy via Portainer

1. Log in to Portainer at `https://portainer.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org`.
2. Go to **Stacks** > **Add stack**.
3. Name your stack (e.g., `whoami`).
4. Paste the contents of your `whoami-stack.yaml` into the **Web editor**.
5. Click **Deploy the stack**.

Portainer will deploy the stack to your Swarm cluster.  
You can now manage, update, or remove the stack from the Portainer UI.

## ü§ñ Continuous Integration Setup with Woodpecker CI (Optional)

Woodpecker CI is an open-source continuous integration system that integrates seamlessly with GitHub and Docker Swarm.  
With Woodpecker, you can automate the build, test, Docker image creation, push to your private registry, and automatic deployment to your Swarm cluster every time you push to a GitHub repository.

### How the CI/CD Flow Works

1. **Push to GitHub:** Every time you push (or open a pull request) on a connected GitHub repository, Woodpecker receives a notification via webhook.
2. **Build and Test:** Woodpecker runs the pipeline defined in the `.woodpecker.yml` file of your repository, which can include build, test, and other steps.
3. **Build Docker Image:** The pipeline can build a new Docker image of your application.
4. **Push to Registry:** The image is pushed to your private registry (e.g., `registry.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org`).
5. **Deploy to Swarm:** You can add a step to update the service on the Swarm cluster, for example using `docker service update` or `docker stack deploy`.

---

### Prerequisites

- **Base stack already running** (Traefik, Portainer, Registry)
- **GitHub repository** containing your application code
- **GitHub OAuth App** to allow Woodpecker to authenticate with GitHub
- **`.woodpecker.yml` file** in the repository with your desired pipeline

---

### 1. Create a GitHub OAuth App

To integrate Woodpecker with GitHub, you need to create a **GitHub OAuth App** for authentication and repository access.

**Steps:**

1. Go to your [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers).
2. Click **"New OAuth App"**.
3. Fill in the application details:
    - **Application name:** e.g., `woodpecker-ci`
    - **Homepage URL:** `https://ci.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org`
    - **Authorization callback URL:** `https://ci.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org/login`
4. Click **"Register application"**.
5. After registration, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**‚Äîyou will need these for Woodpecker setup.

Use these credentials to configure Woodpecker CI for GitHub integration.


### 1.1. Add Woodpecker CI Environment Variables to the `.env` File

To enable proper integration between Woodpecker CI and GitHub, and to ensure secure communication with agents, add the following variables to your `.env` file (in the same directory as `ci-stack.yml`):

```env
WOODPECKER_ADMIN=<your_github_username>
WOODPECKER_GITHUB_CLIENT=<your_github_client_id>
WOODPECKER_GITHUB_SECRET=<your_github_client_secret>
WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET=<your_agent_secret>
```

**Explanation of the variables:**

- `WOODPECKER_ADMIN`:  
    Your GitHub username. This user will have administrator privileges in Woodpecker CI.

- `WOODPECKER_GITHUB_CLIENT`:  
    The Client ID of the GitHub OAuth App you created. Allows Woodpecker to authenticate with GitHub.

- `WOODPECKER_GITHUB_SECRET`:  
    The Client Secret of the GitHub OAuth App. Used for secure communication between Woodpecker and GitHub.

- `WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET`:  
    A secret string (choose a long, random password) shared between the Woodpecker server and agents to authenticate internal communication.

**After adding these variables, save the `.env` file before starting the CI stack.**


### 2. Deploy the Woodpecker CI Stack

The CI stack is **optional** and can be deployed only if you want to enable CI/CD.

To deploy Woodpecker CI, use the provided `ci-stack.yml` file:

```sh
docker stack deploy -c ci-stack.yml ci-stack
```

This will launch the Woodpecker server and agent services in your Swarm cluster.



### 3. Configure Woodpecker CI
1. Access Woodpecker at `https://ci.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org`.
2. Log in with your GitHub account.


#### 3.1. Add Registry Secrets to Woodpecker
Before activating your repositories, you need to add secrets for your private Docker registry credentials. These secrets will be used in your CI pipelines to authenticate with your registry.
1. In the Woodpecker UI, go to **Secrets** (from the sidebar or project menu).
2. Add the following secrets:
    - `REGISTRY_USERNAME`: The username for your private Docker registry (e.g., `admin`).
    - `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: The password you set for your registry (e.g., `Pa55Word`).
3. Save the secrets.  
   You can set these as global secrets or per repository, depending on your security needs.

#### 3.2. Connect Woodpecker to GitHub
1. Activate the repositories you want to use for CI/CD by toggling them in the Woodpecker UI.
2. In the repository options, you can configure whether the pipeline should be **public** or **private**, as well as other security settings.  
    - Go to the repository settings in Woodpecker and choose the pipeline visibility according to your needs.
    - You can also enable or disable features such as network access, filesystem mounts, access to sensitive environment variables, and more.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention:**  
> Some pipelines may require additional permissions.  
> Make sure to enable, in the **Security** section of the repository options in Woodpecker, the necessary features such as:
> - Network access
> - Filesystem mounts
> - Privileged mode
>  
> These options are essential for pipelines that need to perform Docker builds, access network resources, or manipulate system files.  
> Carefully assess the security risks before enabling these options.

Once activated, Woodpecker will listen for pushes and pull requests on these repositories and trigger pipelines as defined in your `.woodpecker.yml`.



### 4. Add a `.woodpecker.yml` Pipeline to Your Repository

Create a `.woodpecker.yml` file in the root of your repository to define your build and deployment pipeline.  
Example:

```yaml
steps:
    # Build and push the Docker image using Buildx
    build-streamv:
        image: woodpeckerci/plugin-docker-buildx:6.0.1
        settings:
            # Clone a repository from GitHub (main branch)
            context: "https://github.com/a_repo/myapp.git#main"
            # Use the Dockerfile in the root of the repository
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
            # Target repository in your private registry
            repo: registry.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org/myapp
            # Tag the image as 'latest' and with the commit SHA
            tags: latest, ${CI_COMMIT_SHA}
            # Push the built image to the registry
            push: true
            # Registry address for authentication
            registry: registry.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org
            # Use secrets for registry username and password
            username:
                from_secret: REGISTRY_USERNAME
            password:
                from_secret: REGISTRY_PASSWORD

    # Update the running service in Docker Swarm with the new image
    update-stack:
        image: docker
        environment:
            # Pass registry credentials as environment variables
            OCI_REGISTRY_USER:
                from_secret: REGISTRY_USERNAME
            OCI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD:
                from_secret: REGISTRY_PASSWORD
        volumes:
            # Mount Docker socket to allow Docker CLI commands This needs Trust Volume checked in the repository settings in woodpeacker!
            - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

> **Note:**  
> To use the Docker CLI inside your pipeline (e.g., for `docker service update`), you must mount the Docker socket.  
> In Woodpecker, ensure you enable **"Trust Volume"** in the repository settings for this to work securely.


Adjust the pipeline to fit your application's needs.
